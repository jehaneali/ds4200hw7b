<h2>Average Flow by Time Period</h2>
<div id="dataviz_brushScatter"></div>
This visualization depicts the average flow for each time period that's tracked.  Interestingly, the time periods 
with the lowest and highest amounts of flow are right next to each other -- time period 9 has an average flow of 84, 
whereas time period 10 has an average flow of 7319.

<h2>Total Ons vs Total Offs</h2>
<div id="dataviz_Scatter"></div>
This visualizations depics the total ons versus total offs for all points in the dataset.  The most surprising thing 
was how different the scales for ons vs offs was -- total ons actually got past 100,000 in some cases, while total 
offs had few past 10 or 11 thousand.

The pop out effect I used was highlighting the rides that were on the orange or green line in their corresponding color.  
I chose this approach because I thought that it was the most intuitive, and that orange and green would really pop out against
a backdrop of gray points, which represent the red and blue lines.
